![build status](https://travis-ci.org/q2ebanking/ember-select-light.svg?branch=master) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-select-light.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-select-light) [![Ember Observer Score](https://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-select-light.svg)](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-select-light)

Ember Select Light is an Ember Addon written [data-down, actions up (DDAU)](https://dockyard.com/blog/2016/11/18/checkbox-list-ember) written with in [test-driven development](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/) practices.

The intent is to provide a barebones `<select>` element that pairs well with modern Ember practices without styling assumptions. The result is a very functional, yet customizable, option for developers seeking a simple solution to select elements in their forms and apps.

## Example Usage

```javascript
this.setProperties({
	myValue: 'turtle',
	myOptions: ['turtle', 'tortoise'],
	myAction: (event) => {
		console.log(event.target.value);
	},
});
```

```handlebars
{{select-light value=myValue options=myOptions change=(action myAction)}}
```

### `value`

String that matches the selected `<option value="...`.

### `options`

#### As a Flat Array

```javascript
['clam', 'starfish']
```

#### As an Array of Key/Value Objects

```javascript
[
	{ value: 'shortfin', label: 'Shortfin Shark' },
	{ value: 'mako', label: 'Mako Shark' },
]
```
`value` and `label` will be the default keys used unless `valueKey="...` and/or `displayKey="...` are used respectively.

#### As a Yield

```handlebars
{{#select-light}}
	<option value="clown">Clown Fish</option>
	<option value="cat">Cat Fish</option>
{{/select-light}}
```

### Handling Events

Any javascript event can be handled directly on the component such as `change` or `focusIn`. The `event` javascript object is passed along to be used however you desire.

Common usages are...

```javascript
myAction(event) {
	console.log(event.target.value); // Do something useful with the changed value
},
```

or to modify a property without a custom action...

```handlebars
{{select-light change=(action (mut myValue) value="target.value")}}
```

### Other parameters

`disabled`, `tabindex`, and `class` work as you'd expect.

```handlebars
{{select-light disabled=true tabindex="0" class="my-dropdown"}}
```
